bash
Copy code
docker build -t compile-c-files .
Run the Docker Container
Run the Docker container interactively:

bash
Copy code
docker run --rm -it compile-c-files
Inside the Container
Execute the script to compile binaries and generate hexdumps:

bash
Copy code
./compile_and_hexdump.sh
Copy Outputs to Host
Copy the outputs (binaries, hexdumps, logs) to your host machine:

bash
Copy code
docker cp <container_id>:/app/host_outputs ~/XplainableAI/host_outputs

# XplainableAI Binary Generation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the XplainableAI Binary Generation Project! This project focuses on generating sets of binaries using various GCC versions and optimization levels. These binaries are used to enable obfuscation detection in binary software through Explainable AI (XAI). The source code for these binaries comes from dummy C files sourced from various tutorial repositories.

## Project Goals

- **Generate Binaries**: Compile C source files using different GCC versions and optimization levels.
- **Enable Obfuscation Detection**: Utilize the generated binaries to detect obfuscation in binary software.
- **Leverage Explainable AI (XAI)**: Use XAI techniques to provide transparent and understandable insights into obfuscation detection.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```plaintext
XplainableAI/

├── c_files/
│   └── (dummy C source files)
├── bin_files/
│   └── (compiled binaries)
├── hexdumps/
│   └── (hexdumps of the binaries)
├── logs/
│   └── (log files for compilation errors)
├── host_outputs/
│   ├── gcc10binaries/
│   │   ├── no_op/
│   │   ├── level1_op/
